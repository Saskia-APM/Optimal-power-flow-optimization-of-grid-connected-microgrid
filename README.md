# Optimal-power-flow-optimization-of-grid-connected-microgrid
This repository is dedicated to the optimization of optimal power flow (OPF) in grid-connected systems, with a focus on enhancing efficiency, reliability, and grid stability. The project encompasses modeling, algorithm development, and simulations to address key challenges such as load balancing and renewable energy integration.

## Key Features
- **Optimal Power Flow (OPF)**: Efficient algorithms to optimize power distribution.
- **Grid Stability**: Methods to ensure reliable operation under varying load demands.
- **Renewable Energy Integration**: Tailored solutions for incorporating renewable sources.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes the [OPTI optimization toolbox](https://github.com/jonathancurrie/OPTI), a powerful tool for solving linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer optimization problems.
